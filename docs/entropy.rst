随笔三十五 熵
======================

自然的本性是熵增。自然的本性也是无序的。

“生命以负熵为食。”——薛定谔。这句话揭示了生命体为了维持自身的有序状态，必须不断从外界获取负熵来抵消自身的熵增加，体现了生命与熵增定律之间的深刻关系。

“人是一条污浊的河流，为了不弄脏自己，你必须成为大海。”——尼采《查拉图斯特拉如是说》。虽然这句话并非直接关于熵，但它隐喻了个体在面对混乱和无序时，应追求更广阔、更有序的存在状态，与熵增定律所体现的从有序到无序的趋势形成了哲学上的呼应。

熵增定律是整个宇宙中最至高无上的定律。

“如果有人指出你的宇宙理论与麦克斯韦方程不符，那么可能是麦克斯韦搞错了；如果你的宇宙理论与观测相矛盾，呃...观测的人有时也会把事情搞错；但假如你的理论违背了熵增定律，我就敢说你没指望了，你的理论只会丢脸、垮台。”

“要构建和谐社会，从哲学本质上来说，就是要建设一个尽量抑制和减缓有效能量消耗，延缓和降低熵流积聚的低熵社会。” 

“天之道损有余而补不足，人之道损不足以奉有余。”——老子《道德经》。

“熵增定律是整个宇宙中最至高无上的定律。” 

“事物的混乱程度越高，则其概率越大。”

熵减是有序的开始，有序都是有代价的，首当其冲是耗费能量。

### Entropy Explained in Simple Terms with Examples

**Entropy** is a concept that comes from physics and information theory, but it can be understood in simple terms as a measure of **disorder** or **uncertainty**. Let's break it down with some everyday examples.

### 1. **Entropy in Everyday Life**

Imagine you have a room. When everything is neat and tidy, the room is in a state of **low entropy**. It's organized, and there's very little disorder.

Now, imagine the same room after a week of no cleaning. Clothes are scattered, books are lying around, and things are generally messy. This room is now in a state of **high entropy**. It's disordered and chaotic.

### 2. **Entropy in Information Theory**

In information theory, entropy measures the amount of uncertainty or information in a message. Let's use a simple example to understand this:

- **Example 1: Coin Flip**
  - Imagine you flip a fair coin. There are two possible outcomes: heads or tails.
  - Before you flip the coin, you don't know what the outcome will be. This uncertainty is a form of entropy.
  - If the coin is fair, the probability of heads is 50%, and the probability of tails is 50%. The entropy here is high because there's a lot of uncertainty.
  - If the coin was biased and always landed on heads, there would be no uncertainty. The entropy would be low because you know the outcome in advance.

- **Example 2: Weather Forecast**
  - Imagine you live in a place where it rains every day. If someone asks you if it will rain tomorrow, you can confidently say "yes" because there's very little uncertainty. This situation has **low entropy**.
  - Now, imagine you live in a place where it could rain or be sunny, and the weather changes frequently. If someone asks you about tomorrow's weather, you're less certain. This situation has **high entropy** because there's more uncertainty.

### 3. **Entropy in Physics**

In physics, entropy is related to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that natural processes tend to increase the total entropy of a system. In simpler terms, things tend to become more disordered over time.

- **Example 1: Ice Melting**
  - Imagine you have a block of ice. The molecules in the ice are arranged in a very orderly, crystalline structure. This is a state of **low entropy**.
  - As the ice melts, the molecules become more disordered and spread out in the water. This is a state of **high entropy**.
  - The process of melting increases the entropy of the system.

- **Example 2: Mixing Colors**
  - Imagine you have two separate containers of paint: one red and one blue.
  - When you mix the two colors together, you get purple. The process of mixing increases the disorder of the system, so the entropy increases.

### 4. **Why Entropy Matters**

Understanding entropy helps us understand how systems change over time and why certain processes happen naturally. For example:

- **Cleaning Your Room**
  - It takes effort to keep your room tidy (low entropy). If you stop cleaning, it will naturally become messy (high entropy).
  - This is why you have to keep putting in effort to maintain order.

- **Predicting Outcomes**
  - In information theory, understanding entropy helps in designing efficient communication systems. If you know the entropy of a message, you can compress it more effectively.

### Summary

Entropy is a measure of disorder or uncertainty. In everyday life, it helps explain why things tend to become messier over time. In information theory, it helps quantify the amount of uncertainty in a message. In physics, it helps explain why natural processes tend to increase disorder. Understanding entropy gives us insights into how systems evolve and why certain changes happen naturally.
