随笔二十八 面对(解决问题)
======================

你现在碰到的每一个困境，基本都是针对你性格的弱点而量身定制的，所以命运会反复出题，直到你给出新的答案为止。

要想强大，方法只有一个，学会出丑，做你害怕的事，战胜你内心所有恐惧。

出丑是最好的成长契机，当你勇敢走出舒适区，不怕犯错，不怕出丑，才能打破局限，收获更多的可能，大胆去做，别纠结他人的看法，你会发现自己远比想象中强大，拥有这份勇气的人，不管做那一行结果都不会差。

急于求成是第1关，心底天高是第2关，跌入谷底是第3关，孤立无援是第4关，自我设限是第5关，接纳一切是第6关，改变自己是第7关，心如止水是第8关，万物皆空是第9关，关关难过关关过，前路漫漫亦灿灿。

**要始终把精力放在解决问题上面，不用自怨自艾，因为不管你关注不关注，问题都是那个样子。--教员**

### AMD CEO Lisa Su on Thinking and Problem Solving

AMD CEO Lisa Su has consistently emphasized the importance of thinking and problem-solving throughout her career. Her approach to these concepts has been instrumental in transforming AMD from a struggling chipmaker into a major player in the semiconductor industry. Here are some key aspects of her philosophy:

### 1. **Run Towards the Hardest Problems**
Lisa Su often shares the advice she received from IBM executive John Kelly: **“Run towards the hardest problems.”** This mantra has become a cornerstone of her personal and professional approach. She believes that tackling difficult challenges is the fastest way to grow and offers the greatest opportunities for learning and standing out.

### 2. **Incremental Improvement and the 5% Rule**
Su advocates for consistent, incremental improvements rather than setting unrealistic growth targets. This approach, known as the **“5% Rule,”** fosters a culture of continuous improvement. She believes that with each new product, AMD can overcome past limitations and steadily advance towards its ambitious goals.

### 3. **Holistic Design Approach**
In the context of chip design, Su emphasizes the importance of a **holistic design approach**. She argues that hardware, software, and systems must be designed together, especially for AI applications. Understanding the overall system application, algorithms, and use cases is paramount before designing the chips, moving beyond designing components in isolation.

### 4. **Leveraging Partnerships**
Su highlights the importance of strong partnerships, particularly with TSMC, as a critical component of AMD’s success. She believes that leveraging the right IP and working deeply with partners is essential for differentiation and innovation.

### 5. **Learning from Mistakes**
Su emphasizes that mistakes are learning opportunities. She recalls that her biggest lessons came from her biggest errors. This perspective encourages a culture of resilience and continuous learning.

### 6. **Focus on High-Performance Computing**
Su has strategically focused AMD on high-performance computing, recognizing its central role in modern technology. This focus has been a key turning point for AMD, enabling it to compete effectively in the market.

### 7. **Open Ecosystem and Collaboration**
In the AI landscape, Su stresses the importance of an open ecosystem. She believes that fostering collaboration and innovation allows for diverse solutions and accelerates development. This approach is particularly relevant in the rapidly evolving AI market.

### 8. **Customer Trust and Transparency**
Su is known for her hands-on approach, often reading customer feedback directly from social media platforms. She believes in building trust through transparency and direct engagement with customers.

### Conclusion
Lisa Su’s emphasis on thinking and problem-solving has been a driving force behind AMD’s transformation. Her strategic vision, combined with a culture of continuous improvement and a focus on high-impact challenges, has positioned AMD as a leader in the semiconductor industry. Her advice to run towards the hardest problems and learn from mistakes offers valuable insights for anyone looking to make a significant impact in their field.
